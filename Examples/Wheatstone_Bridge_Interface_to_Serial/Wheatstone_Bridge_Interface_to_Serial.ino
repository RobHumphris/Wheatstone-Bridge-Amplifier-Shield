/* Wheatstone Bridge Interface - Library */

/*
	This library was created by SÃ©bastien Parent-Charette for RobotShop.
	It is meant to be used with the RB-Onl-38 from RobotShop.
	This product is available here: http://www.robotshop.com/en/strain-gauge-load-cell-amplifier-shield-2ch.html
	This library may work with other WheatStone bridge interface boards that use an analog pin for input.
	
	Changes history:
	2015-10-08
	v1.0
	First release of the library. Basic functionality is available.
